# ABCD-optics_Mathematica-contest-2014

Contest for the best student's Mathematica project on WFAIS UJ at the end of 2013. 1st place. Made in Wolfram Mathematica.

Notebook calculates the optical route using ABCD formalism. Each optical instrument (mirror, lens, and so on) can be described as a 2x2 matrix. You can calculate the optical route for a set of instruments by multiplying their matrices. Notebook allows you to construct an optical route from a set of instruments, calculates the ABCD matrix of the whole setup and gives basic properties for that setup.
